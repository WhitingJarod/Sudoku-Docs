Check board
===========

After naked sets calculations are complete, we need to be able to
evaluate a Sudoku board. We are interested in three possible states:

1.  The board is fully solved
2.  The board is unsolvable (there are cells with no pencil marks left)
3.  The board is unsolved, but may still be solvable.

In the third case, we will continue the solving process (in the next
step) by making a guess on one of the unsolved cells and trying to
solve the board that results. To maximize our chances of guessing
correctly, we will choose the cell with the fewest remaining pencil
marks, calling it the *most constrained* cell.

Write the function:

    check_board(board) ->
        -1: board is unsolvable
        0-80: position of most-constrained cell
        81: board is solved

in the file `check_board.s`. It should scan the entire board and
count the number of pencil marks in each cell. If all of the cells
are solved (they each have exactly one pencil mark value), then
return 81. If even a single cell has zero pencil marks, return -1.
In the remaining case, return the index of the unsolved cell with
the fewest pencil marks. In the event of a tie, return the lowest
index number of a cell with the fewest pencil marks.

Note that this can be implemented as a leaf function (if you write a
loop to count the pencil marks) or you can write it as a non-leaf
function and call your `count_bits` function.

This function examines all positions of the board, but it does not
care about rows, columns, and boxes, so there is no need to use the
lookup table. You can just loop over the 81 positions of the board
in order.

I suggest the following approach:

*   Start with two variables, `most_constrained_index` and
    `most_constrained_count`. Set the initial value of
    `most_constrained_count` to 10 (a number larger than the highest
    possible number of pencil marks), and set the initial value of
    `most_constrained_index` to 81.

*   Examine each cell in order and count the pencil marks. If you
    find zero, return -1 immediately. If you find one, continue the
    loop. If you find more than one, check if this is the new winner
    (the number is less than `most_constrained_count`). If it is,
    record the index of current index in `most_constrained_index`
    and the pencil mark count in `most_constrained_count`.

*   If you reach the end of the loop, return
    `most_constrained_index`. Note that it will still be 81 (its
    initial value) if there were no unsolved squares, and it will be
    the index of the first cell with the lowest pencil mark count
    otherwise.
